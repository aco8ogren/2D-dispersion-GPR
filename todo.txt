Before anything else, convert dispersion_dataset to OOP.
These should have a specific order that wavevectors and eigenvalues are stored in so that they work with the get_empirical_covariance().

start converting 2D-dispersion-GPR to OOP

Things that can be objects:
The GPR model
Interpolation models
Covariance_analyses? Not sure how to organize these. There's a function, a dataset, interpolation style (scattered vs gridded, linear vs cubic?), variance function, sample order
Sample order (this should also be renamed to regression point acquisition order or something)
